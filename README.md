# Survey Data Insights

This is a fun little project where I explored the Stack Overflow 2018 Developer Survey. I used **SQL** to query the data and **Google Sheets** to make some charts and visuals. The goal? See trends in developer types, skills, and job satisfaction.

## Whatâ€™s in here

- Queries for **top countries** of developers  
- **Languages and frameworks** people use  
- **Job satisfaction** levels by developer type  
- Breakdown of **developer roles** like full-stack, front-end, back-end, mobile, data analyst, data scientist, desktop/enterprise, and embedded applications

## How to check it out

1. Download the [Stack Overflow 2018 Survey dataset](https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey)
2. Open it in **DB Browser for SQLite** (or any tool you like).  
3. Run the SQL queries I included.  
4. Copy-paste the SQL results into Google Sheets.  
5. Make charts.

## Skills I got to practice

- Writing **SQL queries** and aggregating data  
- Cleaning and filtering messy data  
- Visualizing insights with **Google Sheets**  
- Spotting patterns and trends in data

## What to do in the future
  
- Add more queries, like exploring salaries or frameworks by country  
- Combine data from multiple survey years  
- Try using **Python** or **Power BI** for more advanced analysis
